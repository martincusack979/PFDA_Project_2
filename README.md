## Project Notebook

In this notebook, I will conduct analysis and investigation of a data set sourced from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, containing data on Breast Cancer 
samples gathered by a team at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics. The features of the data set are calculated from a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a 
breast mass and describe characteristics of the relevant cell nuclei. Using this data set, I will train a number of machine learning algorithms to assess their 
accuracy in determining the class of each sample. I will also carry out a literature review focusing on some of the machine learning research around this 
particular data set and comparing the results documented in various academic papers to my own findings.
